## Objective
### Key Pain Point
Analyzing NBA MVP performance across seasons is often cumbersome and lacks a centralized visualization.
### Ideal Solution
A **Power BI Dashboard** that visualizes NBA MVP statistics, career performances, and key insights using **Python, SQL, and DAX**.
---
## User Story

## Development
### Pseudocode
1. Scrape MVP data from Basketball Reference.

- **Standardizing Data Types**: Ensure numerical consistency.
### Data Exploration Observations
- Some players had multiple teams.
- Some seasons had missing stats.
