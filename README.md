## **📌 Problem Statement**
The NBA MVP Award is given to the best player of the season, but what happens after?  
- Do MVPs maintain their peak performance across seasons?  
- How does scoring efficiency change with age?  
- What trends exist in MVP longevity and playstyle evolution?

---

## **📌 Objective**
This project aims to:
✔ **Analyze** MVP performance across their careers  
✔ **Identify** trends in scoring, efficiency, and positional impact
✔ **Compare** MVPs across eras and playing styles  
✔ **Deliver** data-driven insights for NBA teams and analysts

---

## **📌 Data Source**
✔ **Primary Source:** Scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)  
✔ **Additional Sources:** Player Photos & Team Logos from **NBA.com**  
✔ **Data Fields:** Season, Age, Team, FG%, PTS, AST, TRB, MVP Year  

---

## **📌 Dashboard Design**
The Power BI Dashboard consists of two main pages:
### **1️⃣ MVP Career Stats Overview**
- **Player Selector** (Filter by MVP)  
- **Key Stats:** Points, Assists, Rebounds, FG%, Steals, Blocks  
- **Scoring Efficiency Gauges:** (True Shooting %, Free Throw %, 3P%)  
- **Field Goals Over Age (Stacked Column Chart)**  
- **Points Over Age (Line Chart)**  
### **2️⃣ Analysis Page**
- **Longevity Trends:** MVPs' peak and decline years  
- **Playstyle Evolution:** Comparing 1990s MVPs vs. Modern MVPs
- **Efficiency vs. Volume Scoring:** Impact on career length  
- **MVP Trends by Position & Era (Treemap, Clustered Bar Charts)**  
- **Findings, Recommendations & Action Plan**  

---

## **📌 Tools Used**
✔ **Python** - Web Scraping (Basketball Reference, NBA.com)  
✔ **SQL Server** - Data Storage & Transformation  
✔ **Power BI** - Dashboard & Data Visualization  
✔ **DAX** - Advanced Calculations & KPIs  
✔ **GitHub** - Version Control & Documentation  

---

## **📌 Development**
### **🔹 Pseudocode**
1. **Scrape MVP Data from Basketball Reference**  
2. **Extract Player Photos & Team Logos**  
3. **Store Data in SQL Server & Clean the Dataset**  
4. **Connect to Power BI & Transform Data**  
5. **Build Visuals & DAX Measures for Key Insights**  
### **🔹 Data Exploration**
- MVPs show **consistent peak performance between ages 26-30**  
- **Older MVPs tend to rely more on efficiency than volume shooting**  
- **Defensive MVPs** have **longer careers** than pure scorers  
### **🔹 Data Cleaning**
- **Handled missing team data** by **tracking their last MVP team**  
- **Converted season format** (YYYY-YY) to a **date-friendly format**  
- **Removed duplicate MVPs** (same player winning multiple times)

## **📌 Analysis & Insights**
### **🔹 Findings**
✔ **Peak scoring years** for MVPs are between **26-30**  
✔ **Players with high FG% maintain longer MVP-level careers**  
✔ **Three-point shooters tend to age better in modern NBA**  
✔ **Players who rely on athleticism decline faster than playmakers**  
### **🔹 Validation**
- Data **aligned with historical NBA reports**  
- Accuracy confirmed through **cross-checking external sources**  
### **🔹 Discovery**
- **The next MVP trend will likely favor Playmaking Bigs**  
- **Efficiency over volume shooting is becoming the standard**  
- **Positional trends indicate that guards peak earlier than forwards/centers**  

---

## **📌 Recommendations**
✔ **Teams should prioritize efficient scorers over volume shooters**  
✔ **Develop MVP candidates by emphasizing True Shooting %**  
✔ **Predict the next MVP based on historical patterns & trends**  

---

## **📌 Action Plan**
**Step 1:** Expand dataset to include **Playoff MVPs** for deeper insights  
**Step 2:** Implement **machine learning models** to predict future MVPs  
**Step 3:** Deploy Power BI dashboard for **live updates & external access**
